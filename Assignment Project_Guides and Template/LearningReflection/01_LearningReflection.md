> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?

I had done usability testing before and this did not differ much from that. I found the testing process to be relatively straightforward and not particularly challenging.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.

I wrote and managed my test cases on Visual Studio Code following the examples we were given. I did the steps with the given information to get the tasks done on Gitlab and wrote down the steps. The test cases followed the structure:

*** Test Case ***

Test Case-1 Name
    
Process Step One

Step Two    TestData

Verification or Validation Steps With Expected Data	   


## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 

There are several test case management tools and methodologies available apart from traditional frameworks like Selenium, Cypress, and Robot Framework.

Test Case Management Tools:

Jira: Often used for agile project management, Jira can also manage test cases, defects, and user stories in a collaborative environment.

TestRail: It's a comprehensive test case management tool allowing test case creation, organization, and execution tracking.

PractiTest: Offers a platform for test management, including test design, execution, and reporting.

qTest: Provides a centralized platform for managing test cases, test execution, and defect tracking.

Zephyr: Integrates with Jira and offers features for test case creation, execution, and reporting within Jira.

BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) Tools:

Cucumber: A popular BDD tool that allows writing test cases in a human-readable format using Gherkin language (Given, When, Then).

SpecFlow: A BDD tool for .NET that integrates with Visual Studio and allows creating and managing test cases using Gherkin syntax.

Mind Mapping Tools:

MindMeister, XMind: Mind mapping tools can help in visually organizing test scenarios, making it easier to structure test cases and test coverage.

Wiki-based Tools:

Confluence: Though primarily a documentation tool, Confluence can be used effectively for managing test cases, especially in a collaborative environment.

Custom In-House Solutions:

Some teams prefer to create their own test case management systems using databases, spreadsheets, or custom-built applications tailored to their specific needs.
     

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?

I used Visual Studio Code to edit the files.

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?

Before the testing project zoom session, it was quite difficult to understand what was expected with this project based on the material alone. However, after watching the lecture, things became clearer. I could not find the recaptcha from the sign up page, I tried googling the problem.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?

I have used Github before with my previous courses, and I did not have any trouble using it this time.
 
    
## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )

Any of the mentioned frameworks (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium) can be utilized to automate these test scenarios. 

Robot Framework:

   Keyword-Driven Testing: Robot Framework uses a keyword-driven approach, which aligns well with the structured test cases.
   Readability: The test cases written in Robot Framework are highly readable, making them accessible to non-programmers or stakeholders for review.
   Variable Usage: Utilizes variables and test case structuring similar to the used test case definitions.

Selenium:
    
   Language Support: Selenium supports various programming languages, allowing flexibility in choosing a language best suited to your team's 
   expertise.
   Extensive Community Support: Selenium has a vast community and resources available, which can be beneficial for addressing challenges and           seeking assistance.
   Ability to Interact with Web Elements: Selenium allows direct interaction with web elements, which is crucial for form input and validation.

Cypress:

   Simplicity and Ease of Use: Cypress offers an intuitive API that simplifies writing test cases, potentially reducing the complexity of the test     scripts.
   JavaScript Frameworks: If your application heavily relies on JavaScript frameworks, Cypress might provide advantages due to its native support      for these types of applications.

Selection Criteria:

   Team Skills: If the team is more comfortable with a particular language or framework, consider leveraging their expertise.
   Test Case Structure: If the test cases are structured with keywords and descriptions, Robot Framework might be a good fit due to its keyword-       driven nature.
   Application Technology: If the application heavily utilizes JavaScript or specific frameworks, Cypress might be more efficient due to its           mpatibility.

Conclusion:

Given the structured nature of the test cases and the need for variables and readability, Robot Framework could be a suitable choice. However, Selenium and Cypress can also effectively automate these scenarios, especially if the team has expertise in these tools or if the application aligns better with their capabilities.

Ultimately, conducting a small proof-of-concept or trial tests with each framework can help assess which one aligns best with the project requirements and team proficiency.

Internships, personal projects, or contributions to open-source testing projects can also enhance my resume and demonstrate my practical skills.


## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 

I felt that the videos and book were alright, but the multiple-choice questions did not really test how well you actually learnt the material. The course had very little teaching, it was almost like a fully self-study course. I was expecting the testing project to be more of writing actual test cases with code rather than just testing the functionality. As I had already done usability testing, this was quite similar. Also, as I have previously struggled to write automated tests, it would have been nice to learn more about those. There were quite a lot of written instructions for the project and at times they were quite difficult to follow as there was a lot of text. The project zoom session clarified the instructions though.
